Buffon was both an innovative Enlightment thinker, and a brave scientest. Not only he contributed to the
encyclopedia which amassed an overwhelming amount of knowledge, he was also the steppingstone
of biology who explained how migrations afffected organisms to form different ethnicities and
communities, accelerated evolutions, and inherited their traits to their offsprings, forming
depictable local species till today. He also estimated that the Earth is much older than what people in the
1600s thought. However, his lack of evidence and underestimation of the Earth's age made his therios
doomed. Despite the failure, his inventive thoughts influenced beyond the whole biology scope,
including the ever-famous Darwin who continued on what he had left, fixed what he missed, and
managed to succeed soon after.
