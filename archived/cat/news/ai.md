# AIs, good or bad?

Artificial intellegence has been a topic that has large attention among people. Many people has been
optimistic to AI's developement and usages, while others are afraid that AI is going to replace
their salary with nothing. The latter concerns fits much better to the reality.

Artificial intellegence's invention should be a benifit. However, humanity has proven that they
aren't. How? Firstly, some people would write esseys, complete homeworks, make art with
AI. While this sounds reasonible, it poses risks of human undevelopement. Because you let the AI do
them for you, you don't learn or improve your skills from them. Moreover, they also produce problems
associated with copyright. The data fed to the AI may contain copyrited content and may create new
issues from them.

Next, although AI art has went viral lately, it is dangerous to rely on these art. Because machines
don't have emotions, and art is largely involved with emotions, it isn't sutiable for normal
aesthetics.

To conclude, AIs are a disaster not because of themselves, it's because of natural humanities.
