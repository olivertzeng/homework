# The problems about food safety

Food safety is one of the top priorities of choosing the right food to consume, not to mention that
humans, or should say all organisms, rely on food on a daily basis. Thus, food safety is always a hot
topic to be discussed. Not only it affects how our body will react to the food we eat, it also
affects financially since if people don't trust the food safety that the providers provide, sales
would drop.

I personally had encountered food safety problems when I was fourteen. Looking for food in the
supermarket, I find myself in a variety of vegetables. Because of greediness, I bought the cheapest
from all of the options availble. My greediness however, did not pan out after we found out that a
large portion of it were corrupted after unwrapping. Despite that the plastic container is fully
transparent, the fraud can only be spotted after opening the package. Since that event I was almost
cautious about food safety all the time.

The encounter of this tragic event led me to some solutions for the concern I had. Firstly, the
lables on the package that indicates where it is from and when it expires is a key to pick out bad
options. Next, always look for past scandles about the provider of the food on the internet to
determine it's credibility. Last but not least, rather than constantly being prompted to buy the
cheapest option out there, we should always remain our cautiousness to those lables.

To conclude, food safety after all is still ***a serious problem*** that people should be aware of.
But with those tips in mind, you should be good to fight off food safety and retrieve back your
healthy body!
