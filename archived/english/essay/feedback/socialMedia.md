# How social media affects teenagers' mental health

Studies show that teenagers spend at least three hours on social media per day in average. (Blunder.
Missing a good intro.)

Social media is a new approach that takes the advantage of the internet to provide an online
platform where everyone can share anything with each other. Meanwhile, the rising of social medias
raises a heavy impact on teenagers' mental health (Blunder. Missing context. i.e. coherent issue), addiction to the feed.

Social media has poses several problems on teenagers' mental health (Mistake. Repetition.) because of the features that

Moreover, teenagers may be hiding behind those fancy filters while forgetting about their true self
just for their friends to be amazed and ignoring their true self.

A friend of mine recently sought for my help about his recent increase of uncontrollable emotions,
the lost of focus to a certain task and such. He seems to be like a heavy social media user who
fell into the trap of addiction.

While social media has negative impacts to teenagers, the potential of opening another path of
sharing online is still a notable role of them.

Author's notes: TBH, I'm struggling to express a real-life example in a coherent
manner and would like to improve my wording. Additionally, my unfamiliarity
with this topic is negatively impacting the quality of this essay. Hope that you'll give me some
SOPs on how I can have a much more proper procedure on dealing with this kind of topic.
