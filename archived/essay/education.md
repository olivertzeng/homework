Astronauts, musicians, pilots, these are the common list of jobs kids dream to be. However
these dreams are often shattered by the reality of tests lying ahead of them in the future.
Especially in Taiwan, students tend to believe that tests results are the only thing deciding their
fates. These believes are caused by the overuse of test-based education, ignoring personal interests
and what students want to be in the future.

Despite the pressure test papers causes, it still would not throw out the fire of passion in my heart
towards programming. I was once presented with a difficult choice between giving up my success to
high school or giving up my passion towards programming during middle school. It was a hard decision
but at last I followed my instinct and chose both. By planning a schedule of when to program and
when to study, I effectively did both before the exam, which finally grants me a decent high school
to go to.
