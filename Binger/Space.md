Space colonization may sound feasible in the near future, but there are a few points that people should consider before trying to conquerint the whole universe. First, people rely heavly on electricity, and powerplants needs to be built. However, how do dispose humanwastes? Should we send them back to Earth? Or is there any other ways to dispose human waste without polluting space? Next, we should consider "who" will conquer the space.

Should we make the first people to land have them? Or wait until other people has settled? Recently, China and Russia are trying to take action to colonize space, China even plan to track people's social credit after they settle.

Lastly, if we meet alians somewhere on the planets we visit, should we try negotiate with them? Or still conquer the place without letting them know? These are the points I think that people should consider before trying to make the whole universe to be our own.
