Although the concept of making fungus motherboards is a great idea, but I think that there are still some problems to consider before making that decision. First, fungus are organisms, they depend on moist and a cool environment. However, hardware overheating do happen and if it occurs the fungus will die with your computer. Secondly, people who have mold allergy will suffer from the spores inside the computer. Lastly, the spread of mycovirus can kill the fungus on the motherboard. But I still think that, with some work, fungus computers will soon replace traditional computers.
