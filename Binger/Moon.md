The second stage of the rocket is the most interesting part for me. In programming, to make
programs run faster, and to make the code legible we often remove unused dependencies, debloat stuff to make coding
easier, speeding up both the compiling
proccess and the up time. While the problem they want to solve sounds easy, "removing
stuff" is actually where most people find knotty. Because people need to figure out how they can
remove stuff while still maintain its funcionality.
