The second stage of the rocket is the most interesting part for me. In programming, to make
programs run faster, we often remove unused dependencies, debloat stuff to make the coding
easier, and also try to remove unused code from the source to speed up both the compiling
proccess and the startup time. The problem they want to solve sounds easy, while "removing
stuff" is the most difficult part, because you would actually want to keep the funcionality
while debloating stuff.
