The second stage of the rocket is the most interesting part for me. In programming, to make
programs run faster, and to make the code legible we often remove unused dependencies, debloat stuff to make coding
easier, speeding up both the compiling
process and the up time. While the problem they want to solve sounds easy, "removing
stuff" is actually where most people find knotty. Because people need to figure out how they can
remove stuff while still maintain its functionality.

Another thing that interests me is about sending creatures to space. Sending living things to space
is probably the thing that bothers engineers the most. Because accidents do happen, they tend to
gain a humungous amount of stress. What if astronauts die because I did something wrong? Thus,
     it should be hard being a rocket engineer.
