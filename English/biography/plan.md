Linus Torvalds

Have you ever wondered how developers collaborate with each other in a project? Or have you ever
been curious about where your data is stored when you start browsing the web? Introducing the
legend developer, Linus Torvalds, who started a new era of programming.

It all happened in the 90s, when 22-year-old university student Linus wanted to have UNIX-like process management on his own computer. Back then, there was only MINIX that satisfied his needs, but he was turned down by the strict licensing of MINIX. The spark of writing one from scratch lit his mind. With that in mind, Linus tried tinkering around with his computer during recess in 1991 and started working on his hobby OS, Linux. At this point, he never knew that his "hobby OS" would affect millions of computers worldwide.

As Linux gains more and more attention, Linus would've made a fortune by licensing the kernel as
proprietary. Despite this, he licensed the Linux kernel with the open source license GPL, an abbreviation of the GNU General Public License, as he recalls the disappointment to MINIX about the licensing back in the old days.

Because of this decision, his project began to prosper, and more and more people began to start
using, or even taking part in the Linux project.

However, problems started to arise as the Linux project grew bigger than ever before.
Contributions to the source code is ridiculously hard to manage, different patches lacks proper
communication, and
