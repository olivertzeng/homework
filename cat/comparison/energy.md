# Renewable Energy vs. Fossil Fuels
- Nowadays, renewable energy is a new solution to energy supply. However, renewable energy still
isn't widely used today because of its properties. Here are some key differences:
and similarities between renewable energy and fossil fuels.

## Renewable Energy
- Renewable energy is energy that is produced with renewable resources, which is a natural
  resource that can be recovered faster. In other words, renewable energy is better for the
  environment since it's impactless on nature. However, setting up renewable energy is quite
  difficult and may have a huge amount of cost and drawbacks. Take solar panels as an example,
  solar panels require sunlight; thus, they aren't going to work if it is cloudy.

## Fossil Fules
- Fossil fules is a kind of energy that is produced with unrenewable resources, which is a natural
  resource that can't be recovered in a short time. In other words, we may run out of fossil fules in
  the near future. Also, fossil fules may pollute the environment with carbon dioxide. Desptie it's
  disavantages to renewable energy, its cost is much less, and a power plant can be settled easier
  than renewable energy power plants.

## Conclusion
- Although renewable energy and fossil fules has their own pros and cons, they are both energy
  supplies to humans and are both useful for supplying energy to us.
