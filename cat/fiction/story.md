## Main Story

    On the way to school, my friend Johnny Miller and I were discussing the history assignment that
    was due today. "How do Gaodi architectures differ from Roman ones?" "How did the Renaissance
    improve Europe?" I thought to myself, "I hate history," just as I seemed to bump into something.

    "Whoa! Be careful!" Johnny yelled. The obstacle I had bumped into turned out to be a futuristic-
    looking machine with two buttons. Johnny suggested we take a closer look at the metallic mystery
    box, despite the warning on it that read "DO NOT TOUCH." The bright red color of the buttons
    caught our attention, sparking our curiosity to explore further. Eventually, Johnny couldn't
    resist and pressed the left button. His body disintegrated into countless pixels right after he
    pushed it.

    "Ahhhh!" I cried out in terror, unsure of what to do to save him, when a mysterious whisper
    emanated from the metal box, saying, "You should push the other button to save him." As a close
    friend of Johnny, every word from the whisper affected me deeply. Despite the irrationality of
    the situation, I ultimately pressed the other button. Experiencing my body breaking down without
    pain felt strange yet oddly satisfying. Soon after, I drifted off to sleep.

    And that's when our journey began.

    "Hey, you two! Stop lying in the middle of the road like drunkards! Besides, you probably
    shouldn't be drinking in the morning! Be gone or else." came an unwelcoming shout.
    "Ciao! Welcome to Vinci, Italy from the late 15th century, the age of the Renaissance!" Another joyful but grating sound suddenly jolted me out of my sweet
    dreams. It felt familiar, as if I had heard it somewhere before, but I couldn't place the voice.
    Upon regaining consciousness, I was surprised to find myself lying beside my friend, both of us
    dressed in exotic and ancient clothing reminiscent of what one might find in a history textbook.
    "Issac Wright and Miller Johnny, you're finally awake." Me and my friend finally recognized him as our school
    history teacher. "What are you doing here?" "And what's all about this weird stuff?" we
    questioned.

    "Don't worry students, you'll only stay here for a day. Of course the time that has passed here
    doesn't effect the real world. After that I'll transfer you back to school. But you still have
    to finish your homework! Am I clear?"

    "Wha..." Just when we're about to ask him other questions he suddenly vanished from our sight.
    "Guess that we'll have to figure that out ourselves" I suggested. I seemd confident;
    nevertheless, I'm still worried about where to go. We went for a local villager for help and
    told him about what happened, we were again surprised that he wasn't shocked to hear this. He
    offered us to stay at their place instead. The building looks really different from our hometown. It has a round rooftop with a small crucifix at the top, which reminds me the lightning rod we see back home. It has a relly special facade, with pillars all around the main building like angiles surrounding the goddess. Inside the door there are prototypes scattering all around the floor, two big bookshelfs in the left and the right, a room with enourmous amount of art frames and a man lying on the floor working on a prototype of some kind of machine that we've never seen before.

    The man was so dedicated to drawing that it took some while until he noticis us after we've arrived. "You're finally here," looking at our confused face he then procedded "Your teacher told me what happened to both of you, and asked me
    if I am willing to assist you two if I see them. I accepted this offer because I'm curious
    about what life will be in the 21th century." "You seem to be an expert to everything! Mind
    if I get to know who you are?" I asked. "My name is Leonardo da Vinci, who makes many kind
    of sculptures, devotes in science, loves drawing, and mostly addicted to inventing new kinds of machines to make people's lives easier or increase productivity in everyday tasks." We were interested to what life is like during the Renaissance. "What do you do in your free time?" "I stream on Twitch!" "I watch videos on YouTube!" we shared modern technology like phones to him, as a return he introduced to the technology that he made by himself. Both of the generations enjoyed every moment we met with Da Vinci, it was a great time.

    My stomach started to grumble. "I'm hungry" I argued. "Let's go to lunch!" Da Vinci
    suggested. He took us to a local restaurant that's not to far away from our place. It seems
    that that restaurant is one of Da Vinci's favorite omakase. "Three people please!" After
    some time the waiter handed on the first dish. No wonder it's the food from the ancient I
    thought. "This is risotto, one of Italian's pride. It's mainly rice mixed with butter,
    alcohol, and onions. It mostly comes with meat as well." Da Vinci introduced. After some
    time we eventually finished the meal. I asked Da Vinci if he wants to take a picture with
    us before we go
