# Story

Standing on the big graben he made during the battle, Maxwell is proud of the human lives he has
saved, and is looking forward to future life of living as a hero of all mankind.

Matthew Maxwell was born to a wealthy family. Both Dad and Mom are well-known celebrities who succeeded on studies and aimed to replicate their own paths. Since his childhood, he has been the
one and only who studied algebra at three and learned calculus at the age of ten, studying at collage as a grade-skipping student. Despite the glamorous achievements people see, he suffered extreme stress from his parents every day. One day, when he was yet again being beaten by his mother because he got 99, a small pebble flew from nowhere and hit right at the back of her head. Miraculously, his parents have never hit him since then, nevertheless, he still isn't happy while curious about the truth of the flying stone that saved him from danger until two years later while he was walking back from graduate, a man with a weird hairstyle appeared. "Hey!" is he talking to me, he thought. "Did you hear me, Maxwell?" "Who are you and how did you know my name?"

Bam! The weird man struck Maxwell's stomach hardly with his fists. "Owe! What do you think you are doing!" "You want to challenge me, but hear me out before you take your decision, young man." The man explained that he had a congenital ability to cut and control rocks at his will, even turning the rock into liquid. He saw Maxwell's depressed emotion and tried to help him with his own ability.

The man eventually informed Maxwell that his punch is a special kind of punch that would inherit the
same ability to that person while giving up his own. He said that people call this kind of ability
"earthics". Some other people who were inherited or through bloodline has this ability as well.

"You may have heard this name Lester," He recalled about his parents talking about Lester. They told
him that Lester is a longtime feud with the Matthew family for six whole decades and also warned me
not to get close to him. "He is an enemy to all mankind, but since he has earthics as well, no one
can defeat him, including me as well." "Well, what does that mean to me? Do you expect me to use my
new earthâ€¦ earthics to defeat him?" The man walked away, while looking back smiling at Maxwell like
that Maxwell will beat him.

Maxwell was surprised about this ability that the man gave. He practiced for a while and took on a
trip after that. He beated different enimies sent by Lester and finally the final boss has met
Maxwell.

Lester stood on the streets and said, "You've finally come, I see a worthy opponent. Come, see how
no one can ever beat me" "You must be sure of that." Maxwell said.

Finally Maxwell beated Lester within his inhereted abilities and lives happily ever for after.
