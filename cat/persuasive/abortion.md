# Abortion: Why I Support Abortion Rights

People around the world has been debating about women abortion rights for years. I support abortion
rights and here is some reasons why.

First, women abortion rights should be protected because they should have the rights to decide what
to do with their body. Secondly, women should not have the stress of accidental conception. Next,
embryo inside women's wombs still isn't yet considered as a person. Lastly, women may not want to
afford the pain of pregmency. Thus, abortion rights should be given.

These four reasons concluded why I chose to support abortion rights.
