# Why Linux is just better
## Main Points
### Free and open source nature
- What is it like when you buy some food in a restaurant but can't see how it was made? Similar
is the case when you use proprietary software, for example, Windows. Linux, in contrast
is an open source project, meaning that you can see how Linux works. That way, anyone could
take a look at the code to prevent flaws or malicious means done by the software.
### Customization
- The core feature of Linux is deciding what you want. For example, you can browse,
  install and change icon themes, global themes, window decorations, etc. with ease, while
  the only customization left on Windows is wallpaper changing. (Well, you can still use those
      wacky software found randomly on the internet for Windows, but that isn't what you trust,
      right?)
### Free
  - Windows users need to pay hundreds of dollars to install Windows, while Linux users
  get their OS for free.
## Myths About Linux (Counterargument)
  - Windows is more user-friendly than Linux.
  - It is true that there are some Linux distros, like Arch Linux or Linux from Scratch, that requires
  using the terminal to install. However, more and more Linux distros tend to make the Linux
  experience as user-friendly as they could, such as Linux Mint or Pop!_OS. They provide graphical
  user interfaces that only require a few clicks to install.
  - Windows provides a better gaming environment than Linux
  - Although Linux does have less software support than Windows, that doesn't mean that Linux isn't
  good for gaming. Remember what a hassle it is to install the necessary drivers on Windows? Fear no
  more, because Linux comes with those drivers out of the box, including graphical backends such as
  OpenCL, Vulkan, or even the notorious proprietary Nvidia drivers. Even if Linux doesn't provide
  some other backends you want, you can just install them with the package manager; no further configuration is needed.
