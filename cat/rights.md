United Nations Human Rights Office vs Amnesty International

	Compared to the days when human rights was mostly considered as a mercy from the king, people
    nowadays mostly believes that human rights is essential to every human being. Despite most part
    of the world protects human rights for everyone, there are still some countries that disrespect
    rights of the individual. Thus, there are people who founded organizations to dimish such injustice. These
	include the United Nations Human Rights Office and Amnesty International. Although these two have
    the same approaches, they still have some key differences between them.

    While the United Nations Human Rights Office is an official organization, Amnesty International
    is in fact, an unofficial organization, thus, the latter is much less restricted by political
    means and tensions between different countries than the former. For example, China had
    controversies about violating human rights in 2017 when they tortured muslims in Xinjiang.
    However, because of the consequences these countries will have to face if they go against China,
    they still remain silent to protect themselves.
    On the other hand, Amnesty International puts human rights to the first priority no matter the
    threats from different regimes.

    While there are these differences between them, there are some properties that they share in
    common. As mentioned above, their goal is to protect human rights. Next, they both are
    international organizations, meaning that they serve every nearly every country on earth.
    Lastly, they both think that peace is the only solution for human beings.
