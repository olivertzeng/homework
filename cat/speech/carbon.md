# The Impacts of Carbon Dioxide Since the Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution started in England between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
Its appearance began a new era of production, greatly improving how things are produced, from handmade
to automatic machine production. However, this new change has also affected the amount of carbon dioxide
being exposed to the atmosphere, thus posing some problems for the globe. You'll now see for yourself
how humans have largely impacted the environment in recent years. Firstly, carbon dioxide, water vapor,
and methane are the main greenhouse gases that warm up the Earth. This is called a greenhouse effect.
Due to the rise in temperature, this kind of effect will also make both polar bears' ice melt. As a
result, the melted water raises ocean water levels, causing coral bleaching since corals cannot live
below thirty degrees Celsius. Next, the rise in the amount of carbon dioxide will pose the risk of
ocean acidification because carbon dioxide will release positive hydrogen ions, which are acid ions,
that decrease pH levels. Thirdly, extreme climate change may happen owing to an increasing carbon
dioxide population. The weather pattern could be unstable and may cause lower food production, thus
risking severe famine in some parts of the world. Lastly, tropical organisms may migrate to higher
latitudes and disrupt the proper food chain. It may even decrease environmental capability, causing
local species to die out. These are the four reasons why carbon dioxide influences the environment
negatively. Therefore, people should consider developing renewable and environmentally friendly energy
source alternatives so that we can have a better world to live in.
