# How buying second-handed clothes isn't the solution to fast fashion

Although fast fashion makes having fashion much cheaper, the problems of it has been discussed over
the years, including sweatshops, over producing, and wastes. Some people suggest that buying
second-handed clothes can not only decrease the amount of clothing waste, it also makes retailers'
sales go down if enough people do this at the same time, which might decrease the amount of clothing
being produced. However, this isn't the solution to fast fashion since sales decrease doesn't mean
that these problems will be solved.

Firstly, although buying second-handed clothes might decrease the retailers' sales, it doesn't
convert to decreasing in production rate. On the contrary, it may also make retailers push more
pressure on the workers, which even worsen the sweatshop's problem.

Next off, it's not the consumer's problem. Consumers shouldn't compromise fashion just because of
what the retailers did.

Lastly, there are other better solutions for consumers rather than compromising fashion. One of them
is called giving away old clothes to other people. Currently, there are about 120 billion clothes
worldwide, that's 14 clothes for every person on Earth. Ironically, there are still people who
doesn't have decent clothes to wear, including people working in the sweatshop. Thus, donating old
clothing should be a good plan to both the poor and the consumers, and even solving the never-ending
clothing waste problems.

To conclude, buying second-handed clothes ins't the solution to fast fashion. Rather than sacrificing
fashion and comfort, you could always try other solutions too!
