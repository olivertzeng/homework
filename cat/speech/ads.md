# Ads

Some advertisers love their ads, they are simply their milking cow of money. However, advertising
is bad in some reasons.

First, the appearnce of ads is the destruction of scenery. Imagine when you are visiting your favorite
museum, or climbing a mountain and bumping into a billboard "Here are the bestselling phones", it
would probably break your happy feelings, and your photos as well. Next, the appearnce of digital
ads are taking personal data away from people. Because the advertisers want to know the target audience,
they partner with the platform and collect precious personal data. While this may sound efficient,
these data collection is not a good plan as it sacrifices privacy and also pose risk of making
people suspicious of data selling.
