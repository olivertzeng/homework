# To Vaccinate or not to Vaccinate

Wuhan virus has gone "vi"ral since 2019. Scientists has been developing different kinds of new
vaccines to protect people from the virus. Despite this, some people have concerns about if vaccines
will have serious side effect, or even put extra stress on their bodies. Let's talk about reasons
why people believe in anti-vax, and why the benefits of vaccination far outweigh the risks.

Some folks who resist vaccination has some points in mind. First off, safety. They believe that
vaccines may cause serious side effects such as allergies. History have told them that vaccines
cannot be believed. Take the smallpox vaccine as an example. Although smallpox has been eliminated
for good, it still was associated with a risk of side effects including vaccinatum, progressive
vaccinia, and postvaccinal encephalitis. Next, they believe in natural immunity. They think that
people can live without vaccines. Lastly, folks who wouldn't like to have a vaccine says that it's
important to maintain their own freedom to what they do to their own body.

People who vaccinate argues that it's only rare cases such as the smallpox vaccines that causes
these side effects. Also, they do point out that through vaccination, it could protect public health
by making everyone vaccinate. Another point is that they would rather vaccinate over getting a
disease. Lastly, pro-vaccinators including scientists criticized that believing in natural immunity shows lack of
knowledge about vaccines.

It's clear that getting a vaccination is the only way to survive through the black sad blanket that
diseases has put is to get a vaccine as soon as possible, so that we can work together to
create a safer, healthier world for everyone.
