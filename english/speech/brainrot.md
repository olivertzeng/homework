* Sometimes work sofa
* as a person who was born with the Internet, i can tell you that there are no particular meaning of
  this word
As you scrolled through various Reddit feeds, your eyes suddenly caught the peculiar word "skibidi" and wondered to yourself: "What could it mean?"

* in fact tons of words like these viral
Growing up during the Internet era, it's no surprise to see random words like these to go viral among our generation.


This phenomenon is often referred to as 'brainrot', a trend largely driven by young people who can only concentrate for a short amount of time.

It's actually not really surprising to see people gaining shorter and shorter attention spans across generations. Older generations seems to enjoy longer media formats such as movies and YouTube videos, while we prefer scrolling through tons of 30-second TikToks or YouTube Shorts.

This shift reflects why fast-paced humor like 'brainrot', is taking over the Internet. For example, Australian senator Fatima Payman got critizied by using brainrotting words such as 'skibidi' or 'forgor' in the parliament last year.

To tackle this issue, it's vital for parents to engage their children in activities that don't involve screens. By introducing them to books, board games, or other off-screen media,

parents can help significantly improve their kids' attention spans while protecting their eyes from screens.

In conclusion, the term 'brainrot' serves as a wake-up call to address the growing problem of shorter attention spans. By consuming steeper content and encouraging healthier habits, we can help the next generation thrive in an increasingly digital world.
