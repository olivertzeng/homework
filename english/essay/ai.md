# AIs: The Balance between Ethics and Technology

Artificial intelligence has garnered significant attention among people. While many are optimistic
about AI's development and usage, there are ethical issues associated with its development that
cannot be ignored. Here are some of the questionable problems that AI produces

Recently, an AI art competition sparked controversy when some artists argued that generated artwork
harmed copyright and shouldn't be promoted or rewarded. Furthermore, AIs are cold, emotionless
machines, thus art produced by them lacks the aesthetic value of human emotions. Some argue that AI-
generated art can help people without skills enter the art world, but this approach may compromise
the value of human creativity and skill.

Censorship is another concern in AI development. While AI censorship can prevent illegal activities
such as rebellion, piracy, and weapon creation, some argue that it restricts fundamental human
rights-freedom. Topics namely torrenting and dark web surfing occupy a gray area, as they may be
associated with piracy and other illegal activities. However, individuals in unstable countries,
such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, may rely on these tools to protect themselves and access
vital information. For instance, Christians in Pakistan may use Tor and dark web browsing to access
the Bible without fear of persecution from Islamic terrorists such as Taliban. On the other hand,
uncensored AIs may enable illegal activities to flourish. Neither approach provides a clear solution
to this ethical dilemma.

Tech companies often prioritize showcasing their AI capabilities over actual product improvements.
While AIs may seem convenient, the chaos they produce raises questions about their value to humans.
