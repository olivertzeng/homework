"I'll be an astronaut in the future!" This might be common to hear when you ask a child what they
would want to do in the future, but if you were to ask a teenager what to do, most of them would
rather not bother thinking or saying things that what people think might be "the best for them" like
doctors. Especially in Taiwan, students in middle school or high school tend to believe that tests
results are all that matters. Their spark of passion has been ceased by the stress that has been put
by the tests.

People would think: "Why not change the way of learning? Instead of learning the current textbooks,
why not learn whatever they like?" This has a downside compared to the current method however, that
the learning cannot be standarlized or tested whether if a person is qualified or not, since every
person has their own set of materials they learn with. So the best way to learn is to follow the
current "test-based" learning with the school while learning what your interest points to in your
own free time.

I'm one of the top in my class, but being a bookworm does not mean I do not have an interest. I love
programming, and I spend an enourmous amount of time practicing my skills. Such as algorithms,
syntaxs, or even version management. I had an exam called the CAP that would determine the final
school you would go to according to your test result. Thus, I had to choose between studying tests
and going foward with my interest. But I refused to choose between them and did both. Not only did I
get a great result from the exam, I also gained a lot of knowledge just from committing code onto
GitHub and interacting with other developers. I'm glad that I can keep my passion while maintaining
my own test score.
