"I'll be an astronaut in the future!" This might be common to hear when you ask a child what they
would want to do in the future, but this dream and hope would be shattered by the reality of tests
lying in front of them. Especially in Taiwan, students in middle school and high school tend to believe
that tests results are the only thing deciding their future lives. These believes are caused by the
use of test-based education instead of interest-based education. This indicates that schools teaches
them what they want instead of what each of the student want to learn.

Although I am one of the tops in class, I still have a strong passtion towards programming.
Even if a test is just around the corner, I still strive to take some of my time savoring the sweet
taste of putting my logical thoughts into programming languages.

I once had an important exam that would determine the school you would go to according to the test
result when I was in middle school. Because of my strong interest towards programming, I strugged
deciding between studying for my test or going foward with my interest. But for the sake of my own
future I decided to do them both. Because of my dedication, not only did I accomplish my greatest
feats on developing my own new algorithm, I also made new friends along the way. Although I tried
my best, my exam score was just only satisfactory. However, in this test-based education
environment, it is still worth sacrificing some test score for my own interest and passion on
something I like the most.
