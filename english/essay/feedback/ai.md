# AIs: The Balance between Ethics and Technology

## General Mistakes

* Lack of thesis statement
* Ambigious wording(readers aren't mind"readers")
 * Solution: be in the reader's shoe(in specific, remember to check using BFS i.e. Breadth-first
   search)
* ~~**People, That and There is/are**~~ bloat/reduncdant words
> * Why so passive? Go aggresive! You have all the powerful words you have! And you're hiding it on

## "Local" Mistakes
Artificial intelligence has garnered significant attention **among people**(Mistake. Best words are *globally*). While many are optimistic
about AI's development and usage, ~~**there are**~~ (Mistake. Best word is *its*) ethical ~~**issues associated with its development that**~~ (Blunder. Best words are *implications*)
cannot be ignored. Here are some of the ~~**questionable problems**~~ (Blunder. Best words are *key
ethical challenges*) that AI produces. (Blunder. Thesis satement missing.)

(Blunder. Prep i.e. key point/argument/topic sentence missing.)
Recently, an AI art competition sparked controversy when some artists argued that generated artwork
harmed copyright and ~~**shouldn't**~~ (Inaccuracy. Best words are should not) be promoted or rewarded. Furthermore, ~~**AIs**~~ (Inaccuracy. Best words are AI) are cold, emotionless
machines, (Mistake. Conjunction word missing.)thus art produced by them lacks **the aesthetic value**(Blunder. Explanation of the word *aesthetic* missing.) of human emotions. Some argue that AI-
generated art can help people without skills enter the art world, but this approach may compromise
the value of human creativity and skill.

Censorship is another (Mistake. The word *significant/important* missing.) concern in AI development. While AI censorship can prevent illegal activities
such as rebellion, piracy, and weapon creation, some argue that it restricts fundamental human
rights-freedom. Topics namely torrenting and dark web surfing occupy a gray area, as they
~~**may**~~ (Inaccuracy. Best word is *can*) be
associated with piracy and other illegal activities. However, individuals in unstable countries,
such as Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, ~~**may**~~ (Inaccuracy. Best word is *mainly*) rely on these tools to protect themselves and access
vital information. For instance, Christians in Pakistan may use Tor and dark web browsing to access
the Bible without fear of persecution from Islamic terrorists such as Taliban. On the other hand,
uncensored AIs may enable illegal activities to flourish. Neither approach provides a clear solution
to this ethical dilemma.

Tech companies often prioritize showcasing their AI ~~**capabilities**~~ (Mistake. Best word is *advancements*) over actual product improvements.
~~**While**~~(Inaccuracy. The best alternative word is *Although*) AIs may seem convenient, the chaos they produce raises questions about their value to humans.(Mistake. Conclusion missing.)
