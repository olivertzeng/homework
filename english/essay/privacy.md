# The Importance of Privacy

In these digital days, people spend nearly all of their days in the world of zeros and ones,
especially connecting with other people via the Internet. Some even make a living with it, like
YouTubers. But just like in real society, the Internet is full of dangerous dark corners that
hunts everything from you, including your personal data, statistics, activity, and so on. Despite
that, we can still combat that with some technics that can protect our own privacy.

Firstly, substitute proprietary software with open source alternatives. This is the most important
one on the list because of its simplicity. The reason of this is that open source software's
source code can be seen by everyone, plus its openness makes contributing easy, making
security patches and bug fixes be gone soon after someone discovered its vulnerability.
On the other hand, proprietary software doesn't allow the source code to be released to
the public, thus it creates a giant black box and do whatever they want, including collecting
personal data without user notice. Even if open source software implements personal data
collecting components, other people in the open source community would know and report it back
to the users about the fishy stuff in the source code in no time.

Some open source software alternatives to closed sourced ones include: Linux to Windows,
LibreWolf to Google Chrome, VSCodium to VSCode, and so on.

Next, use content blockers or ad blockers to block ads and protect privacy. Things like
uBlockOrigin can block a numerous amount of ads globally and essentially decreases load time, also
protecting your privacy by blocking personal ad preferences statistics.

Lastly, always read word by word and make sure you understand everything before proceeding.
Have you ever encountered countless alerts and agreements before you start using an online account
or a new app? If you do, stop mindlessly clicking the "Agree" button because that it may tell
you to agree with personal data collection and so for. In addition, read through every privacy
policy of a web service word by word before agreeing to it. In that way, you won't every
encounter times when you don't know that your data has been collected.

A few days ago, I learned that my email data has been sold on a data broker's website for a dollar.
With this unfortunate news in mind, I tried to seek to why my personal data is on there and how
I could solve this problem. The first thing in mind is that I put my email on my social media
profiles, that is a huge blunder as other people can easily find the user who is associated
with the email. So the solution is to use yourdigialprivacy.com to email that specific
data broker using EU's GDPR regulation and start removing my own email from all my public
profiles.

In conclusion, privacy is a huge topic and maintaining it is hard since that there are a lot of
hunters out there who is staring on you like a thief. So just always keep in mind to keep your
data safe and using these methods I mentioned your data should be safe in no time!

### P.S.
* Sometimes I have trouble on shortening the essay without changing the main ideas, especially for
  topics that I have great passion in. How do I keep my essay shorter like extracting an extract?
