# The Importance of Privacy

Privacy is one of the key parts of human rights. It is highly focused, especially during these
digital days, where data brokers collect user information for their own good. So these are some
ways to fight against them and give you back what you own.

One effective way is to substitute proprietary software with open source alternatives. Open source
software compared to proprietary ones is that it allows examination of the source code. Thus, you
can check if the source code contains unnecessary telemetry, enabling better privacy while avoiding
the black box that closed-sourced ones have.

The most popular solution on this list is to use content blockers to block website tracking and
advertisements. Based on the fact that advertisements often come with tracking and collecting
personal preferences to gain more revenue, blocking them can enhance your privacy once more. uBlock
Origin for instance, can block a significant number of advertisements on the web so that you can
have an ad-free experience.

Lastly, read word by word in contracts you are about to agree with. Digital services often provide
various terms of services or privacy policies before you proceed with using their product. They
mostly state what user data will be collected and how it will be in use. Thus, you would want to
see the conditions for yourself before blindly clicking the "Agree" button to preserve your own
digital rights.

Recently, a friend of mine who was constantly harassed by spam mail and phone calls called me for
help. He was unaware of the importance of his email address and gives them away whenever people ask
for it. I suggested he change his phone number and email address. Moreover, I emailed data brokers
to unassociate his email from their database according to the GDPR. Although it was quite a painful
process, he finally knows the importance of privacy and how to protect it.

In conclusion, privacy is a huge topic, maintaining it hard since there are a lot of hunters out
there who are staring at you like a thief. That's why maintaining privacy is such an important duty
for everyone.
