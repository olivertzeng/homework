# The problems about food safety

Food safety is one of the top priorities of choosing the right food to consume, not to mention that
humans, or should say all organisms, rely on food on a daily basis. Thus, food safety is always a hot
topic to be discussed. Not only it affects how our body will react to the food we eat, it also
affects financially since if people don't trust the food safety that the providers provide, sales
would drop.

I've actually encountered a shocking event associated with food safety once. When I was fourteen
looking for food in the supermarket, I find myself in a variety of well-packaged vegetables. The one
and only that caught my eye is the one which is significantly cheaper than the other ones. However
after we unwrapped the leaf vegetables we bought, we were astonished to find out that a large portion
of it were corrupted. Despite the package is fully transparent, the fraud can only be spotted after
opening the package.

To truly solve this problem, as consumers we should properly check if there are any sorts of trace
that can track the source about where the food came from. In that way, not only it informs if it's
past the expiratory date or not, it also tells us if the food is from a trustworthy source.

Lesson learned that maintaining food safety is really important in our day-to-day lives. So we
should always look for ourselves if the food we eat are safe or not.
