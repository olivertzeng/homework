# How social media affects teenagers' mental health

Studies show that teenagers spend at least three hours on social media per day in average.

Social media is a new approach that takes the advantage of the internet to provide an online
platform where everyone can share anything with each other. Meanwhile, the rising of social medias
raises a heavy impact on teenagers' mental health, addiction to the feed.

Social medias' feeds sort posts with the algorithm so that users would want to keep scrolling
through them. However, especially for teenagers, this feature encourages addiction to them and harms
their mental health, and often delays things that's more important.

A friend of mine recently sought for my help about his recent increase of uncontrollable emotions,
the lost of focus to a certain task and such. He seems to be like a heavy social media user who
fell into the trap of addiction.

To conclude, social media has negative impacts to teenagers and should be limited.
