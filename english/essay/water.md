# Ways to save water for the environment

Water resource is the most important resource that we need to preserve, because organisms cannot
live without water. Moreover, industrials and all sorts of factories use lots of water to make
products for everyday-use, from the tissue paper you see on your desk to those clothes you wear.
Thus, we should decrease the amount of water usage so that we can preserve them for other needy
people.

Our approach is to take a shower instead of a bath. Taking a bath might be entertaining for our body.
However, most of the time, taking a shower instead can also achieve the same target while save an
incredible amounts of water.

To do so, my family and I had a plan to reward whoever takes the least amount of baths per week. At
first it didn't go as expected since we really had a strong feeling of taking a bath because the
comfortable feeling it provides. But as time goes on, we then discovered that taking a shower is
much less time-consuming than a bath. At last because of the rewards and the discovery of the good
thing of taking a shower instead of a bath, we managed to save a drastic amount of water at last.
Now, even without the rewards, we are always willing to take a shower instead of wanting gallons of
water just for our own comfort.

To conclude, you'll often find out that only the times when water shortage comes you see water
precious. So, it's vital that we take immediate actions to cut down unnecessary water usage so that
we can enjoy a better world not for ourselves, but for everyone.
