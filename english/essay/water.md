# Ways to save water for the environment

Water resources have been lacking in some parts of the world nowadays, especially in third-world
countries. So saving water is the one topic that gets a lot of attention lately. Me and my family
have had attempts to save water and succeeded afterward.

Our approach is to take a shower instead of a bath. Taking a bath might be entertaining for our body.
However, most of the time, taking a shower instead can also achieve the same target while save an
incredible amounts of water.

To do so, my family and I had a plan to reward whoever takes the least amount of baths per week. At
first it didn't go as expected since we really had a strong feeling of taking a bath because the
comfortable feeling it provides. But as time goes on, we then discovered that taking a shower is
much less time-consuming than a bath. At last because of the rewards and the discovery of the good
thing of taking a shower instead of a bath, we managed to save a drastic amount of water at last.

To conclude, tracking water usage and improve it accordingly like how we did is a really crucial part
of water-saving. So try it out in the future if you could!
